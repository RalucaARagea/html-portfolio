<h1>The Best Movies according to Raluca</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Emperor's new groove</h3>
<p>
  This is my absolute favourite movie. It has everything I need to cheer up on a
  blue day. It never fails to make me laugh even though I saw it like a million
  times already.
</p>
<h3>Everything everywhere all at once</h3>
<p>I cannot describe this movie. You just have to see it.</p>
<h3>In time</h3>
<p>
  Looking back at this movie makes me realize that it could've been an episode
  of Black Mirror. The mechanics of how time works here just make sense to me in
  an existential kind of way. It puts in perpective that old saying: "Time is
  money".
